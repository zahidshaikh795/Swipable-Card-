For Swipabble Card view :

I have used kolodaView whose files you can dowload from there pubic gibhub repository.

Working of card view:
1)Swipe left or right to mark is as read 
2) There is an undo button if you want to read previious card
3) There is also progress bar which shows the percentage of completed readings.
